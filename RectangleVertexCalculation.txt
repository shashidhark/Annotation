Rectangle annotation with rotate option. 
Challenge: Find coordinates when one vertex moved to some position.
This is straight forward when the rectangle sides are vertical and horizontal. We 
need to apply methematic theory to calculate this when the rectangle is rotated to an angle.


Let ABCD be the vertices of a rectangle

A--------B---B'
|	 |   |
|	 |   |
D--------C---C'


Let l1 is line represents one side of a rectangle. 
Edge say A-B.

Conside we moved point C to new location C'(x', y'), this changed the point B to B'.
Following is the method to calculate B'.

Let l2 is new line perpendicular to A-B passign through B'. 
Edge say (B-C)' Line joining B1 and C'.

Equation of line l1 : y = m1*x + b1 ---------1
Equation of line l2 : y = (-1/m1)*x + b2 ----2
Take m2 = -1/m1
Hence

From (1) we calculate: b1 = y - m1*x
From (2) we calculate: b2 = y - m2*x
Note: x and y can take from any vertex of a corresponding line

y intercepts of this intersection is same, then from 1 & 2 we get
m1*x + b1 = (-1/m1)*x + b2  -----------------3
From this we can calculate x coordinate at intersection.

Once we get x value, apply that value to the equation 1 or 2 to calculate y.

These x and y is the coordinate of new point. B'.
